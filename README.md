# React Layout Generator

This project is an experiment to see what css in javascript can do for dynamic and responsive layout. It started with a simple state machine that produced a sequence of blocks (think grid) and then was expanded to a component to allow responsive and dynamic layout. It is called react-layout-generator and is available on npm.

To install use:

```javascript
yarn add react-layout-generator
npm install react-layout-generator
```
