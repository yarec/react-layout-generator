# Contributing

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help this project come to fruition. üëè Some ideas:

1. Components designed to use RLG

2. Examples

3. Generators

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

- Fork the repository

- Clone it and install dependencies

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/react-layout-generator

RLG includes an examples sub-project so it too will need to be initialized using npm or yarn. See the package.json in each for scripts supported.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands npm run build and npm run test:prod are working.

Finally send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/chetmurphy/react-layout-generator/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done (read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). You can use the [pull request template](https://github.com/chetmurphy/react-layout-generator/issues). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
